# Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation
This repository contains an unsupervised machine learning to create a customer segmentation for credit card user based on their credit card usage. The project designed to help the credit card issuer to identified their customer better.

## Project Overview
Credit Card Customer Segmentation projects aim to create a segmentation for credit card customer using unsupervised machine learning with `K-mean Clustering Algorithm`. By analyzing their credit card history usage and identifying patterns, the project can help credit card issuer to identified their customer behavior and giving them rewards & promotion based on their wealth. The project involves exploratory data analysis, data cleaning & preprocessing, feature engineering, model training & evaluation and model improvement.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Yellowbrick

## File Description
- `CC_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook containing the code used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training & evaluation and model improvement.
- `CC_Customer_Segmentation_Inference.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook containing the code for model inference testing.
- `credit_card_data.csv` : CSV file containing the data of Credit Card History.

## Algorithm Used
- K-mean Clustering

## Result
The Credit Card Customer Segmentation project was able to successfully create a segmentation for the credit card customer with details as follows :
- Segments 1
A customer who have average income and didn't use their credit card very often as we can see their purchases is low although they have decent credit card limit. But they tend to pay their bill better than segment 2.

The Flight Price Prediction project was able to successfully the flight price with an `R2Score` of `94.3%` and 1.4s predict time. The project identified the most important features that influcences the flight price and created a predictive model that can be used to predict the price for future flight. These can be used by Airlines to help them to evaluate their ticket price by comparing it with their competitor.
